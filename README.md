# Unity 3D Kata - Short technical test

Spend 1 – 2 hours creating a very basic scene and character controller that demonstrates your understanding of Unity 3D and Zenject.

## Submission Guidelines
Please perform granular, succinct commits; this is not expected to be a perfect piece of code, we’re more interested in how you approach the problem and whether or not you understand the principals involved. Keep it simple!

The code requested is simple and should be largely your own – please do not copy & paste code from another source or a tutorial.

If you feel you can demonstrate TDD as part of this process in a timely fashion, please do. Code annotations also welcome.

Once complete, send the repository link to us or the agent who will forward it to us.

If you have any concise, publicly available code that can demonstrate your understanding of Zenject and design patterns, then please feel free to submit this in place of this test – as long as it is easy to follow and easy to identify that you wrote the code.

## Task

* Create a public repo on the git provider of your choice (please do not fork)
  * Enable LFS
  * Set up ignore and attribute files for a Unity 3D solution
* Create Unity project
* Create a scene with a basic floor
* Implement Zenject and demonstrate a way of using it in the following task:
  * https://github.com/modesttree/Zenject
  * Create a basic character controller that you can move with the arrow keys
  * Any perspective or camera settings (2D or 3D) – whichever you find easiest and quickest to implement
* Set up an iOS target build (for a basic development package)
* Document where possible. At the very least, indicate which version of Unity 3D you created the solution in and how to build the app.
